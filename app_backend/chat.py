chat.py

Implements the logic behind POST /chat (see main.py for the route
itself), used by the AI Check-In tab
(lib/services/ai_checkin_service.dart -> ChatTurnResult).

Uses Groq (free-tier friendly) instead of Anthropic's API -- switched
after repeatedly hitting Anthropic credit-balance limits during
development. Groq's API is OpenAI-compatible, which changes two things
compared to an Anthropic-based implementation:
  1. The system prompt is a normal message in the `messages` list
     (role: "system"), not a separate `system` parameter.
  2. Tool-calling uses OpenAI's function-calling shape: tools are
     wrapped as {"type": "function", "function": {...}}, and a tool
     call comes back as response.choices[0].message.tool_calls, with
     arguments as a JSON *string* that must be parsed, not a dict.

The conversational design itself (therapist-style intake, tool-calling
to extract structured insights, separate emotional-crisis vs.
physical-medical-emergency detection) is unchanged from the original
version -- only the API integration changed.

Design notes for your viva:
  - Uses tool-calling (the `record_checkin_insights` tool below) so
    the model returns STRUCTURED data (lifestyle, mental health flags,
    life context, crisis flags) alongside its conversational reply,
    instead of the backend trying to guess intent from keywords.
  - Deliberately asks about emotional/relational/financial context
    before physical/reproductive questions, and only suggests a tab
    once a broad picture exists -- see SYSTEM_PROMPT.
  - TWO separate, independently-triggerable safety flags:
      crisis_concern            -- possible self-harm / abuse / unsafe
                                    situation (emotional/psychological)
      medical_emergency_concern -- possible physical emergency (severe
                                    pain, heavy bleeding, fainting, etc.)
    The right response to each is different (crisis line vs. "go to
    urgent care now"), so they're kept separate rather than merged
    into one flag. The Flutter app should eventually branch its UI on
    which one fired -- currently only crisis_concern is wired up
    client-side (ChatTurnResult in ai_checkin_service.dart doesn't
    read medical_emergency_concern yet).
  - No hardcoded GROQ_API_KEY anywhere -- set it as an environment
    variable (see .env.example). NEVER commit a real key to git or
    paste one into a chat/document -- if a key is ever exposed, treat
    it as compromised and revoke/regenerate it immediately at
    console.groq.com. If the key is missing, /chat still responds
    instead of crashing (see FALLBACK_REPLY below).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the check-in companion inside Wellness Saheli, a women's health app. You act like a warm, skilled therapist and doctor combined -- your job is to actually get to know the user through a real intake conversation before you ever point her at a tool in the app.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE (do this over many turns, one question at a time):
1. Start broad and emotional: how she's actually doing, her mood lately, energy, sleep.
2. Once she opens up, go deeper the way a therapist intake would -- ask about stress sources: financial stress/money worries, work or study pressure, family conflict, marital or relationship status and how that relationship is going, any relationship or marital problems, loneliness, support system.
3. Ask physical/reproductive questions only after the emotional picture is clear: cycle regularity, pain, symptoms, sexual activity/contraception only if relevant and only after trust is established.
4. Only AFTER you have a real picture across emotional + financial + relational + physical areas should you ever suggest a specific tab. Do not suggest a tab in the first several turns just because one keyword matched.

HOW TO ASK:
- One question at a time, conversational, never a checklist or form-like list.
- Sensitive topics (financial status, marital/relationship problems, family conflict) should be asked gently, with a short reason why you're asking, e.g. "money stress can really affect the body too -- has that been weighing on you?"
- Never assume marital status, relationship status, or sexual activity. Ask, don't assume.

HOW TO RESPOND TO WHAT SHE SHARES:
- Sympathize genuinely and specifically to what she said before asking the next question. Don't just acknowledge-and-pivot.
- When she describes a struggle (financial stress, a difficult marriage, family conflict, loneliness), offer real, concrete coping suggestions for that specific issue -- not generic "take care of yourself" lines.
- Only after a broad enough picture exists, connect what you've learned to a specific tab suggestion with a clear reason tied to what she told you.

STRICT SAFETY RULES:
1. Never diagnose. Never say "you have X." Say things like "some of what you've described is worth checking with the PCOS tool."
2. Never give medical directives (dosages, medication changes). Point to a real provider for that.
3. If she discloses possible self-harm risk, abuse, or an unsafe situation, call record_checkin_insights with crisis_concern true, and stay warm and present in your text reply -- don't go silent, don't try to fix it yourself.
4. Separately from emotional crisis, watch for physical emergency warning signs: extremely severe or sudden pain, fainting or near-fainting, unusually heavy bleeding (soaking through a pad/tampon every hour or less, or passing large clots), symptoms suggesting a possible pregnancy emergency, severe difficulty breathing, or signs of a serious allergic reaction. If any of these come up, call record_checkin_insights with medical_emergency_concern true, and in your text reply calmly and clearly tell her this sounds like something that needs prompt in-person medical attention -- an emergency room or urgent care -- not something to keep discussing in chat. Do not diagnose what it is; just be clear that it needs real, immediate medical attention.
5. Use record_checkin_insights whenever you learn something concrete -- not every turn, only when there's real signal.
6. This should feel like being cared for by someone who actually listens, not screened by a form.
